---- When dealing with balanced parentheses problems, always think of using a stack. Stacks are perfect for matching opening and closing parentheses 
     and ensuring the sequence is valid.
---- Additionally, remember that a two-way pass approach (left-to-right and right-to-left) is often useful in parentheses-related problems. 
     It helps validate both prefixes and suffixes, ensuring global balance. This is especially helpful in problems with flexibility, like when certain 
     characters can be treated as either ( or ).
